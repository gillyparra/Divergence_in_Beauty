# Divergence_in_Beauty
This is a GitHub repository that analyzes soccer teams' performance influenced by cultural and institutional factors. It contains Python notebooks for data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization of international soccer rankings.

## Repository Overview
This repository contains Python Jupyter notebooks used to analyze the influence of cultural and institutional factors on the performance of national soccer teams. The notebooks perform various data manipulation tasks, including data cleaning, scraping, statistical analysis, and visualization, supporting the research findings presented in the paper "Divergence in Beauty."

## Files Description
- **Data cleaning and Graphs.ipynb**: This notebook handles preliminary data cleaning, removing inconsistencies, and preparing the data for analysis. It also includes code for generating initial visualizations that help understand data distribution and preliminary insights.
- **Fifa webscrape.ipynb**: This tool focuses on scraping historical soccer data from FIFA and Wikipedia. This data forms the basis for constructing the institutional and cultural indexes used in the regression models.
- **Regressions.ipynb**: Contains the regression models that analyze the effects of the institutional and cultural indexes on the "All-Time Rank" of national soccer teams. The outcomes help quantify how much each factor contributes to soccer success.
- **Econ hit 1.ipynb** and **Econ hit 2.ipynb**: These notebooks include additional data manipulations and exploratory data analysis that supplement the main findings, offering deeper insights into specific variables.

## Contribution to the Paper:
- **Data Collection**: Automating the extraction of current and historical data necessary for building robust datasets.
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and organizing data to ensure accuracy and relevance for statistical testing.
- **Analysis**: Implementing and running statistical models that directly support the research hypotheses by quantifying the impact of various factors on soccer performance.
- **Visualization**: Creating graphs and charts visually representing trends and results, making the data more accessible and understandable.

## About the Paper
The paper "Divergence in Beauty" investigates the impact of institutional and cultural indices on the international success of soccer teams. By creating these indices and integrating them into regression analyses, the paper identifies significant influences that these non-athletic factors have on a country's soccer performance. The findings aim to provide insights that could help policymakers and sports administrators enhance the development and success of soccer teams nationally.
